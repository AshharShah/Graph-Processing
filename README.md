# ⭕️ Graph-Processing ⭕️

This is a GUI based project which was given for the course of Data Structures and Algorithms in my 3rd semester.

🔴 About the Project:

  🔹 Reads data from a .txt file named PPI-1 and processes it into a graphical form.

  🔹 Uses SDL2 to display the graph in a circular form with nodes and edges.




🔴 Operations it can do:

  🔹 Display the adjacency list of the graph.

  🔹 Display the graph.

  🔹 Find and display the Minimum spanning tree (Prims Algoritm).

  🔹 Find and display the shortest path from a source node to a target node (Dijkstra's Algorithm).

  🔹 Count the total number of nodes.

  🔹 Display the node with the minimum and maximum edges.
